Including it would create a perfect multicolinearity, hence why it is dropped from the model. This same reasoning can be applied to industry. Assuming the industry someone stays in does not change over time, the regressor has no within-individual variation due to it being perfectly mutlicolinear with entity fixed effects, and so is dropped out of the model.\n",

    "- **Income** \n",
    "    - Income is statistically significant (p = 0.008 at the 1% level). Based on the coefficient estimate, for ever 1 pound increase in income, savings increases by £0.83, ceteris paribus. This indicates very strong savings behaviour amongst the data.\n",
    "- **Family Status**\n",
    "    - Family status is statistically significant at the 1% level, p = 0.009. Therefore since this is a binary variable, individuals with a child exhibit a £5807 increase in savings against those without a child based on the estimated coefficient, ceteris paribus. \n",
    "- **Previous Savings**\n",
    "    - Previous Savings is highly significant, since at the 0.1% level, p < 0.001. The coefficient estimate of -0.171 indicates that for every 1 pound increase in previous savings, savings decreases by £0.17, ceteris paribus.\n",
    "- **Interaction term: Income x Family**\n",
    "    - This interaction term is statistically signifciant at the 5 % level since p = 0.014. The coefficient estimate of -0.058 indicates that the effect of income on savings depends on family savings. In the case of no child, the increase of 1 pouund in income increases savings by 0.83 according to the estimated savings coefficient, ceteris parabus. For the case where an individual has a child, each additional £1 of income increases savings by £0.77 due to the reduction of £0.06 from the interaction effect, ceteris paribus.\n",

    "The F-test is a powerful statistical tool that helps determine whether adding additional terms (variables or groups of variables) to a regression model produces a statistically significant improvement in model fit. Rather than evaluating individual coefficients, the F-test assesses multiple coefficients jointly, making it ideal for variable selection decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Core Principle: Nested Model Comparison\n",
    "The F-test works by comparing two nested models—a restricted model (with fewer parameters) and an unrestricted model (with additional parameters). The fundamental idea is that while adding more variables will always reduce the residual sum of squares (RSS), not every reduction is meaningful. The F-test determines whether the improvement is statistically significant or merely due to chance.\n",

    "\n",
    "Key Advantages Over Individual Tests\n",
    "The F-test offers a crucial advantage over t-tests that evaluate individual coefficients: It can assess multiple coefficients simultaneously. This matters because variables might appear individually insignificant yet jointly contribute meaningful predictive power. Conversely, the overall F-test might indicate joint significance while individual t-tests show no individual significance—revealing that the variables work together to explain the variance in ways that aren't apparent from single-coefficient tests.​\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall F-Test for Model Significance\n",
    "One specific application is the overall F-test of regression, which compares your full model to an intercept-only model (containing no predictors). If this test is significant, your model predicts the response variable better than simply using the mean of the response.​\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical Application in Variable Selection\n",
    "In stepwise selection procedures, the F-ratio guides decisions about whether to add or remove variables. At each step, the algorithm evaluates whether including (or excluding) a variable significantly improves model fit using the F-statistic. This approach balances goodness-of-fit with model parsimony—avoiding unnecessary complexity while ensuring the model captures meaningful relationships in the data.​\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt 2:** explain more of how f test can check if adding extra predictors increases fit relative to model noise.\n",
    "    OUTPUT: An F-test checks whether the drop in error you get from adding predictors is large compared to the random noise left in the model. In other words, it asks: “Is the extra explained variation big relative to the unexplained variation, once we account for how many predictors were added?”​\n",
    "\n",
    "Idea: signal vs noise\n",
    "When extra predictors are added, the residual sum of squares (RSS) always goes down, but that drop may just be random noise. The F-test compares the average reduction in RSS per new parameter (signal) to the average residual variance in the bigger model (noise).​\n",
